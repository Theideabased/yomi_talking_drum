CHAPTER 3: METHODOLOGY

3.1 INTRODUCTION

This chapter presents a comprehensive methodology for developing a talking drums dataset for artificial intelligence pattern generation by systematically leveraging existing digital audio resources. The methodology is mathematically rigorous and computationally robust, incorporating advanced signal processing techniques, statistical analysis, and machine learning algorithms. Rather than pursuing primary data collection, this research adopts a resource-integration approach that curates, processes, and synthesizes available materials from multiple sources including community-contributed platforms, academic archives, and established music information retrieval datasets.

The methodology encompasses five core phases: (1) systematic resource identification and acquisition, (2) comprehensive audio processing and quality enhancement, (3) multi-dimensional feature extraction and analysis, (4) extensive annotation and metadata development, and (5) AI model implementation and validation. This approach enables immediate research implementation while establishing scalable methodologies for future dataset expansion.

The framework integrates traditional ethnomusicological principles with modern computational techniques, ensuring cultural authenticity while meeting the technical requirements of contemporary AI systems. By focusing on available resources, this methodology provides a practical pathway for advancing African music AI research without the constraints of field data collection.

Research Design and Approach

Resource-Integration Framework

This research adopts a comprehensive resource-integration approach that systematically leverages existing digital audio materials rather than collecting new recordings. The framework is built on four pillars:
